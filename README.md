## Example

Here's a quick example of how you can use Math-To-Manim to create an animation for the Pythagorean theorem:

```python
from manim import *

class PythagoreanTheorem(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        a = Tex("a").shift(LEFT)
        b = Tex("b").shift(UP)
        c = Tex("c").shift(RIGHT + UP)

        # Draw right triangle
        triangle = Polygon(LEFT, UP, RIGHT + UP)

        self.play(Create(triangle))
        self.play(Write(a), Write(b), Write(c))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how you can create a simple animation using Manim to visualize the Pythagorean theorem. With Math-To-Manim, you can easily generate similar animations for a wide range of mathematical concepts.
